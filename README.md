Game Overview

You control Subject 84, a captive of the Origins program that is dedicated to the pursuit of creating the perfect super soldier through human experimentation. The Origins     program is housed in a facility floating in the sky. One day, an experiment on Subject 84 goes wrong causing a massive explosion in the laboratory. With his restraints destroyed, Subject 84 seizes the opportunity to escape through the massive hole now extending through the whole facility. Run, jump, and mid-air boost your way out of the Origins program facility.
